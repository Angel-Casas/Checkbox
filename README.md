# Checkbox
Checkbox is a website which allows you to create your own schedule around the things you most want to get done during a daily/weekly/monthly period.
It comes with an option to check or cross wether you have or haven't completed your objective.
The more you maintain your objectives the greener the box will be, but if you fail a red card will remind you to work hard!
